# PlanetSurfaceGravity
The purpose of this project is to display the surface gravity for all 8 planets using the formula provided to us. 

We must have methods (separate from the method ) in order to calculate the surface area of the planets. 

In the main method, we will need to write code to display the output. 

This project will allow us to the surface area formula given to us to calculate the surface area of all planets. 
We will then need to call the methods in the main method to print the output correctly.

<+s>: This program allowed me to understand how methods separate from the main method "work together" to create output on the screen. 
This is essentially calling methods in the 1 main method. 

<-s>: Overall, the program was great practice as it helped me understand the concepts by actually doing; 
however, I did have a rough start (especially with the calculations and the formulas). 
However, I was able to find the surface area for all planets and the results I got were close to the actual surface area. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding how to call methods and work with different methods other than the main method was a good practice and will help me in the future.
